# Extracting "Total Experience" from Job Descriptions

## Objective

You are provided with an Excel sheet containing 3000 Job Descriptions (JDs). Your task is to:

1. Research and choose 5–6 models or techniques to extract the total experience required for
   that job from each JD. You can choose Langchain or hugging face or transformers as per your
   preference
2. Write a code which implements all model in single code to give comparison of the output of
   each model extract total experience.
3. Compare the results from each model and output them in an Excel sheet. Use parallel
   processing to run efficiently
4. Analyze which model performs the best based on consistency, logic, or accuracy (as per your
   understanding).
5. Submit your recommendation of the best model with justification.

## Guidelines for Research & Model Selection

• Share the Final Running code
• Share the generated output excel sheet
• Think of a holistic algorithm to start out to Extract “Total Years of Experience” as mentioned
in JD
• Go through data well, and the variations in JD
• According to you which is the best approach
• In case of writing a prompt, be vigilant to which prompt should be used for which model
